    1: Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

    For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

    2: String Manipulation
    - Write a function that returns the string "something" joined with a space " " and the given argument a. Examples:

    giveMeSomething("is better than nothing") ➞ "something is better than nothing"

    giveMeSomething("Bob Jane") ➞ "something Bob Jane"

    giveMeSomething("something") ➞ "something something"

    2: Word without First Character
    Create a function that takes a word and returns the new word without including the first character.
    
    Examples
    
    newWord("apple") ➞ "pple"
    
    newWord("cherry") ➞ "herry"
    
    newWord("plum") ➞ "lum"
