Basic of js

Question 1 Write a function to render the following pattern in the console:
*****
****
***
**
*



The function needs to take a number as a parameter which represents how many asterisks are rendered on the first row.

Question 2 Censor Words Longer Than Four Characters Create a function that takes a string and censors words over four characters with *.

Examples censor("The code is fourty") ➞ "The code is ******" censor("Two plus three is five") ➞ "Two plus ***** is five" censor("aaaa aaaaa 1234 12345") ➞ "aaaa ***** 1234 *****"

Note

Don't censor words with exactly four characters. If all words have four characters or less, return the original string. The amount of * is the same as the length of the word.

 Question 3 Converting Objects to Arrays Write a function that converts an object into an array, where each element represents a key-value pair.

Examples

toArray({ a: 1, b: 2 }) ➞ [["a", 1], ["b", 2]] toArray({ shrimp: 15, tots: 12 }) ➞ [["shrimp", 15], ["tots", 12]] toArray({}) ➞ []

Note * Return an empty array if the object is empty.

 Question 4 Filter Repeating Character Strings Create a function that keeps only strings with repeating identical characters (in other words, it has a set size of 1).

Examples

identicalFilter(["88", "999", "22", "545", "133"]) ➞ ["88", "999", "22"] identicalFilter(["xxxxo", "oxo", "xox", "ooxxoo", "oxo"]) ➞ []

Note * A string with a single character is trivially counted as a string with repeating identical characters. * If there are no strings with repeating identical characters, return an empty array (see example #3). Question 5 Return the Objects Keys and Values Create a function that takes an object and returns the keys and values as separate arrays.

Examples

keysAndValues({ a: "Apple", b: "Microsoft", c: "Google" }) ➞ [["a", "b", "c"], ["Apple", "Microsoft", "Google"]] keysAndValues({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }) ➞ [["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]] keysAndValues({ key1: true, key2: false, key3: undefined }) ➞ [["key1", "key2", "key3"], [true, false, undefined]]

Notes * Remember to sort the keys.
